# config_unit_test

This is a sample unit test using pytest (Needs it to be installed if run locally) <br>
`.travis.yml` is required if you are using TravisCI (continuous integration) <br>
`.github/workflows/github_actions.yml` is required for GitHub Actions (GitHub based continuous integration)

Within the folder, just type in command prompt:

`pytest -v`

This shows that the unit test is performed whenever code is committed.
